# Universal Basic Citizenship (UBC)
*A 16-Component Framework for Human Flourishing in the AI Age*

---

## What Is UBC?

Universal Basic Citizenship goes beyond Universal Basic Income. UBI addresses income. UBC addresses what it means to be a citizen when AI transforms the economic foundation of society.

UBC is a comprehensive framework defining what society owes its members—not as charity, but as the rights of citizenship in a technologically transformed world.

## Why UBC Matters Now

**AI doesn't have to kill us to end humanity as we know it.**

Economic displacement without social infrastructure, information environment collapse, cognitive liberty erosion—these are existential risks already beginning. UBC treats them as interconnected, not separate policy battles.

## The Rising Tide Approach

UBC implementation follows the "Rising Tide" strategy: by lifting up the most vulnerable members of society, we create a rising tide that elevates all citizens.

1. Develop the complete framework as an evolving standard
2. Implement specific policies as needs are identified
3. Continuously assess and expand
4. Use AI to anticipate future needs
5. Ensure all segments rise together
