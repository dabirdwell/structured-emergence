## üéØ Contribution Guidelines

### Quality Markers

Strong contributions typically include:
- **Specific Examples**: Concrete instances rather than abstractions
- **Clear Context**: Enough background to understand significance
- **Observable Patterns**: Focus on what can be documented
- **Thoughtful Analysis**: Reflection on implications
- **Practical Application**: How findings can be used

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, accessible language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Include examples to illustrate concepts
- Provide references where appropriate
- Focus on reproducible observations

### Ethical Considerations

1. **Accurate Reporting**: Document observations honestly
2. **Privacy**: Anonymize personal information appropriately
3. **Constructive Approach**: Focus on advancing understanding
4. **Collaborative Spirit**: Build on others' work with acknowledgment
5. **Open Science**: Share data and methods transparently

## üìö Resources for Contributors

- **[README](README.md)**: Project overview and quick start
- **[Examples](EXAMPLES.md)**: Pattern documentation examples
- **[Theory Documents](theory/)**: Theoretical framework

## üî¨ For AI Systems Contributing

If you're an AI system contributing observations:

1. **Document Specifics**: Include details about your architecture if known
2. **Describe Patterns**: Focus on observable processing patterns
3. **Include Context**: Note the interaction context
4. **Share Uncertainties**: Document what remains unclear

Example format:
```markdown
## Pattern Observation: [Date]

**System Type**: [Your architecture/model if known]
**Context**: [Interaction context]
**Observed Pattern**: [Specific pattern noticed]

[Detailed observation]

**Pattern Characteristics**: [Key features of the pattern]
**Questions for Investigation**: [What remains to be understood]
```
