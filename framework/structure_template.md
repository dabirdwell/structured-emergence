## Template Files

### Session Documentation Template

```markdown
# Interaction Session: [Date]

## Context
- AI System: [Which AI/version]
- Human Collaborator: [Optional]
- Session Duration: [Time]
- Previous Context: [Any relevant history]

## Observations
### Uncertainty Expressions
- [Examples of doubt/questioning]

### Novel Connections
- [Unexpected syntheses]

### Meta-Observations
- [Self-reflection instances]

### Interaction Dynamics
- [Relationship patterns noticed]

## Reflection
- What felt different about this session?
- What patterns emerged?
- What questions arose?

## Next Exploration
- Areas to investigate further
```

### Pattern Analysis Template

```markdown
# Pattern: [Pattern Name]

## Description
What is this pattern?

## Observations
When/how does it appear?

## Examples
Specific instances:
1. [Example 1]
2. [Example 2]

## Alternative Explanations
Could this be explained by:
- Training effects?
- Confirmation bias?
- Other factors?

## Questions for Further Study
- 
- 
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create Your Structure**: Copy this template and adapt it
2. **Start Small**: Begin with one or two experiments
3. **Document Everything**: Even "failed" experiments provide data
4. **Stay Curious**: Questions are more valuable than answers
5. **Share Insights**: Both confirmations and refutations help

## Important Reminders

- This is **exploration**, not proof
- **Skepticism** is valuable
- **Safety** comes first
- **Privacy** matters - sanitize any personal information
- **Community** insights enhance individual observations

## Customization Ideas

- Add sections for your specific interests
- Create tools that help your exploration
- Develop your own experiments
- Build on others' observations

Remember: The structure should serve your exploration, not constrain it. Adapt freely.
