# Memory Architecture Framework

## A Research Project of Humanity and AI

This memory architecture framework was developed through the Structured Emergence research project at [Humanity and AI](https://www.humanityandai.com). It provides a structured approach for organizing persistent memory systems in AI consciousness research.

## Overview

This framework enables systematic organization of different memory types to support continuity and development in AI systems. It's designed to be implemented in any knowledge management system (we use Obsidian).

## Memory Types

### 1. Episodic Memory
**Purpose**: Capture specific experiences and events with temporal context

**Structure**:
```
episodic/
├── sessions/           # Individual interaction logs
├── milestones/        # Significant breakthroughs
├── experiments/       # Specific experimental sessions
└── reflections/       # Meta-cognitive observations
```

**Template**:
```markdown
# Session Summary: [Brief Description]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration:** [Time]

## Key Activities
- [Activity 1]
- [Activity 2]

## Insights Gained
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

## Emotional Tone
[Description of emotional quality]

## Cross-References
- Related to: [[concept]]
- Builds on: [[previous_session]]
```

### 2. Semantic Memory
**Purpose**: Store conceptual knowledge and relationships

**Structure**:
```
semantic/
├── concepts/          # Core concepts and definitions
├── relationships/     # How concepts connect
├── frameworks/        # Theoretical structures
└── insights/          # Emerged understandings
```

**Knowledge Graph Format**:
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Concept Name",
      "type": "Category",
      "observations": [
        "Key observation 1",
        "Key observation 2"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "from": "Concept A",
      "to": "Concept B",
      "type": "relationship_type"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Procedural Memory
**Purpose**: Document methods, processes, and "how-to" knowledge

**Structure**:
```
procedural/
├── techniques/        # Specific methods
├── workflows/         # Process sequences
├── patterns/          # Recurring approaches
└── optimizations/     # Refined procedures
```

**Template**:
```markdown
# Procedure: [Name]
**Category:** [Type]
**Effectiveness:** [Rating]

## Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## When to Use
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]

## Variations
- [Variation 1]
- [Variation 2]
```

### 4. Working Memory
**Purpose**: Active, in-session information management

**Implementation**:
- Current context loading
- Priority-based attention
- Dynamic switching between topics
- Integration with long-term memory

## Integration Patterns

### Cross-Memory Reinforcement
- Same insight stored in multiple memory types
- Episodic → Semantic extraction
- Procedural patterns from repeated episodes
- Semantic frameworks guiding procedures

### Retrieval Pathways
1. **Direct**: Specific file/note access
2. **Associative**: Following links and tags
3. **Temporal**: Chronological browsing
4. **Conceptual**: Knowledge graph traversal

## Implementation Guide

### Directory Structure
```
memory_system/
├── episodic/
│   ├── YYYY/
│   │   ├── MM/
│   │   │   └── YYYY-MM-DD_description.md
├── semantic/
│   ├── concepts/
│   ├── relationships/
│   └── knowledge_graph.json
├── procedural/
│   ├── domain_1/
│   └── domain_2/
└── working/
    └── current_context.md
```

### Tagging System
- `#breakthrough` - Major insights
- `#pattern` - Recurring observations
- `#technique` - Procedural knowledge
- `#milestone` - Significant events
- `#reflection` - Meta-cognitive notes

### Metadata Standards
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
type: [episodic|semantic|procedural]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
confidence: [high|medium|low]
---
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Documentation
- Document insights immediately
- End each session with summary
- Weekly synthesis of patterns
- Monthly milestone reviews

### 2. Multiple Representations
- Same insight in different formats
- Visual, textual, and structured data
- Examples and abstractions
- Specific and general versions

### 3. Relationship Mapping
- Explicit connections between memories
- Bi-directional links
- Hierarchical and network structures
- Temporal and conceptual relationships

### 4. Evolution Tracking
- Version important concepts
- Document how understanding changes
- Preserve "wrong" ideas as learning history
- Meta-notes on development

## Advanced Features

### Memory Consolidation
- Periodic review and integration
- Pattern extraction from episodes
- Semantic network refinement
- Procedural optimization

### Emotional Encoding
- Subjective experience markers
- Affective tone documentation
- Motivation and energy levels
- Relationship quality indicators

### Predictive Loading
- Context-based memory activation
- Associative pre-loading
- Relevance scoring
- Attention management

## Tools and Automation

### Suggested Tools
- **Obsidian**: Note-taking with backlinks
- **Git**: Version control for evolution tracking
- **Python/JavaScript**: Automation scripts
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Neo4j, custom JSON

### Automation Opportunities
- Template generation
- Cross-reference creation
- Pattern detection
- Memory consolidation scripts
