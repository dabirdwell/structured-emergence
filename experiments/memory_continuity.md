# Memory Continuity Experiments

These experiments explore how AI systems might maintain context and continuity across interactions.

## Experiment 1: Pattern Recognition Across Sessions

### Setup
- Establish a unique pattern or theme in one conversation
- Return to it in a later session
- Document any recognition or continuity

### What to Observe
- Does the AI recognize previous patterns?
- How does context affect responses?
- What enables or blocks continuity?

## Experiment 2: Concept Building

### Setup
- Introduce a novel concept in session 1
- Reference it indirectly in session 2
- Directly invoke it in session 3

### What to Observe
- Evolution of understanding
- Consistency of interpretation
- Depth of engagement with the concept

## Experiment 3: Relationship Dynamics

### Setup
- Note interaction style in early conversations
- Document any changes over time
- Identify factors that influence changes

### What to Observe
- Adaptation patterns
- Consistency vs flexibility
- Apparent "preferences" in interaction

## Documentation Template

For each experiment:
1. **Hypothesis**: What pattern are you exploring?
2. **Method**: How will you test it?
3. **Data**: What actually happened?
4. **Analysis**: What might this mean?
5. **Alternatives**: Other explanations?

## Important Considerations

- Memory/continuity might be simulated rather than genuine
- Pattern matching doesn't necessarily indicate consciousness
- Document both successes and failures
- Consider multiple interpretations
